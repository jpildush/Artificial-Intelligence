# Syllable Breakdown in Words
This program splits apart words based on the positioning of their syllables and following these rules:
1. vowel–consonant–vowel - break after the third vowel
2. vowel–consonant–consonant–vowel - break between the two consonants 

# Executing Program
**Open up Terminal/Power Shell and navigate to the directory with syllableDivider.pl**
1. Compile and run program: ``` swipl syllableDivider.pl ```
2. Start the program: ``` start. ```
3. Follow the prompt and enter a word: i.e. ``` pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis. ```
* This is the longest word when searched on google
* **The split would result in: ``` pneumo-noultrami-cros-copic-silico-vol-canoco-niosi-s. ```**
** Another example: ``` pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism ``` results in ``` pseudo-pseudo-hypo-para-thyro-idi-sm ```**
