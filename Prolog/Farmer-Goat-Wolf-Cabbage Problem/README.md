# The Farmer-Goat-Wolf-Cabbage Problem
The FGWC problem is a very famous problem solving task where the farmer intends to bring the goat, wolf, cabbage and himself
over from the east side of the river to the west side of the river. There is a boat by the river that the farmer is able to use,
but the boat can only carry two at a time, including the farmer. 

These animals and objects are not able to be together, since they would devour one another, while the farmer is not with them:
1. The Wolf should not be left alone with the Goat
2. The Goat should not be left alone with the Cabbage
